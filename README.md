ciphers
=======
A series of small python scripts to experiment with 
the implementation of various ciphers. You can 
generally assume that a limited amount of testing 
was done. 

These are all for educational and demonstration 
purposes only. 


Substitution - Unidirectional. Creates a basic 
substitution cipher of the provided message based on 
a randomized alphabet. Good for generating cryptoquips.
